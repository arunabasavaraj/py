<h1>PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER:1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with high-level programming capabilities.<br>
<h2>AUDIENCE</h2>
This Python tutorial series has been designed for those who want to learn Python programming; whether you are beginners or experts, tutorials are intended to cover basic concepts straightforwardly and systematically.

<h2>REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE</h2>
To learn the Python programming language, you do not need any previous programming knowledge. Nevertheless, a basic understanding of any other programming languages ​​will help you understand Python programming concepts quickly
.<br>Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with high-level programming capabilities. It has become famous because of its apparent and easily understandable syntax, portability, and easy to learn.
<br>Python is a programming language that includes features of C and Java. It provides the style of writing an elegant code like C, and for object-oriented programming, it offers classes and objects like Java.
<h2>SOME IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT PYTHON</h2>
Python was developed in the late eighties, i.e., the late 1980's by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands as a successor of ABC language capable of exception handling and interfacing.
Python is derived from programming languages such as ABC, Modula 3, small talk, Algol-68.
Van Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from a TV show, Monty Python's Flying Circus.
Python page is a file with a .py extension that contains could be the combination of HTML Tags and Python scripts.
In December 1989, the creator developed the 1st python interpreter as a hobby, and then on 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features.
On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and included new features.
Python is an open-source scripting language.
Python is open-source, which means that anyone can download it freely from www.python.org and use it to develop programs. Its source code can be accessed and modified as required in the project.
Python is one of the official languages at Google.  

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS AND FEATURES OF PYTHON</h2>
Interpreted Language: Python is processed at runtime by Python Interpreter.
Object-Oriented Language: It supports object-oriented features and techniques of programming.
Interactive Programming Language: Users can interact with the python interpreter directly for writing programs.
Easy language: Python is easy to learn, especially for beginners.
Straightforward Syntax: The formation of python syntax is simple and straightforward, which also makes it popular.
Easy to read: Python source-code is clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
Portable: Python codes can be run on a wide variety of hardware platforms having the same interface.
Extendable: Users can add low level-modules to Python interpreter.
Scalable: Python provides an improved structure for supporting large programs then shell-scripts.<br><br>

<h2> CHAPTER:2 PYTHON INSTALLATION</h1>
Python source code is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python interpreter is free, and downloads are available for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux ) in the form of source and binary. You can download it from the Python Website: python.org.
The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python on those machines where it is available; putting: /usr/local/bin in your UNIX shell's search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command "python" to the shell.

Python 3 can be installed On Ubuntu Linux by using the following command from the terminal.
On Windows machines, a Python installation is usually placed in C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python(Version), although you can change this while running the installer.

To install Python on a Windows machine, follow these steps:

Download Python for Windows.
Run the Python installer.
Here you will see the Python wizard, which is very easy to use. Just accept the default recommended settings and click on the Next button, wait until the install is complete and you are done.

<h3>PYTHON GUI </h3>
There are various GUI based Python IDE that python programmers can use for better coding experience.

Names of some Python interpreters are:

PyCharm
Python IDLE
The Python Bundle
pyGUI
Sublime Text etc.

<h3>There are two modes for using the Python interpreter:</h2>
Interactive Mode
Script Mode
Without passing the python script file to the interpreter, directly execute code to Python prompt.

Alternatively, programmers can store Python script source code in a file with the .py extension, and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file. To execute the script by the interpreter, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the file. For example, if you have a script name MyFile.py and you're working on Unix, to run the script you have to type:
<h3>COMMENTS IN PYTHON</h2>
Comments are non-executable statements in Python. It means neither the python compiler nor the PVM will execute them. Comments are intended for human understanding, not for the compiler or PVM. Therefore they are called non-executable statements.
A single-line comment begins with a hash (#) symbol and is useful in mentioning that the whole line should be considered as a comment until the end of the line.<br>
Multi-line comment is useful when we need to comment on many lines. You can also use a single-line comment, but using a multi-line instead of single-line comment is easy to comment on multiple lines.<br>

In Python Triple double quote (""") and single quote (''') are used for Multi-line commenting. It is used at the beginning and end of the block to comment on the entire block. Hence it is also called block comments.
<h2>DECLARATION AND ASSIGNMENT</h2>
Keywords are reserved words in Python and used to perform an internal operation. All the keywords of Python contain lower-case letters only.
<h3>PYTHON OPERATORS</h3>
Operators provide a vital role in programming, and in combination with values and other identifiers form expressions and statements, which is also an essential building block for Python programming.
Python operators are symbols that are used to perform mathematical or logical manipulations. Operands are the values or variables with which the operator is applied to, and values of operands can manipulate by using the operators.

Let us take a Scenario:

6 + 2=8, where there are two operands and a plus (+) operator, and the result turns 8.

Here a single operator is used to manipulate the values. The +, -, *, / and ** does addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & exponentiation respectively.
Python programming language is rich with built-in operators.

Python supports the following types of operators:
Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison (Relational) Operators
Logical Operators
Identity Operators
Bitwise Operators
Membership Operators
<h3> PYTHON NUMBERS</h2>
As we know, programming languages have their prime things - Numbers, Data types, Strings, Variables, etc., which play a significant role in constructing a program.
When we say Numbers, we mean to say Python programming supports integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. These are number-based data types that store various types of numeric values. Number objects get generated when programmers assign a value to them. For example:
In Python, the numeric variables are defined as:
int
float
complex
Python provides four distinctive numerical types. These are:

signed int: include the range of both positive as well as negative numbers along with whole numbers without the decimal point.
long int: a special type of integer is having an unlimited size and is written like integer value before the letter L (either uppercase or lowercase).
float (real values): They are used with a decimal point to represent real numbers, and that decimal point (dot) is used to divide the integer and the fraction.
complex: are complex numbers that take the structure a+bJ where a and b are floating-point numbers and that 'J' represent the square root of -1 (imaginary number).

Python has the capability and feature to convert within an expression containing the mixture of different types of values internally.

int(v): is used to convert any value 'v' to a plain integer
long(v): is used to convert a value 'v' to a long integer
float(v): is used to convert a value 'v' to floating-point value
complex(v): is used convert a value 'v' to the complex number having real part 'v' and imaginary part as 0
complex(u,v): is used convert values u and v to the complex number with real part 'u' and imaginary part 'v'

<h3>PYTHON STRINGS</h2>
A string is usually a bit of text in programming that is written to be displayed to users. It is known to Python when you want to display a string. This is because programmers use either double quote " or single quote ' to enclose a word or group of words to express a string.
Characters are not supported by Python, which makes it simpler as characters in Python are treated as strings of length one and hence considered as a sub-string.

The program is showing the use of strings and how they are displayed on-screen.
These are special characters represented by a backslash followed by the character(s), and they are used for particular purposes. They can be interpreted using both single and double-quotes. The lists of Escape Characters in Python are:

\a: alert
\b: backspace
\cx: Control X
\e: escape
\f: Form feed
\n: Newline or next line
\r: carriage return
\s: space
\t: tab
\v: Vertical Tab

<h3>PYTHON DATATYPES</h2>
Python data types are different in some aspects from other programming languages. It is simple to understand and easy to use. Because Python is interpreted programming language and Python interpreter can determine which type of data is storing, so no need to define the data type of memory location.
The data type determines:

The possible values for that type.
The operations that can be done with that values.
Conveys the meaning of data.
The way values of that type can be stored.
Everything in Python programming is an object, and each object has its own unique identity(a type and a value).

There are many native(built-in) data types available in Python.

Some important are:

Numbers: An are integers (such as 1, 2, 3…), floats (such as 2.6, 4.8, etc.), fractions (such as ½. ¾, etc.), or even complex numbers.
int (signed integer)
float
long
complex
Sequences:
Strings: Sequence of Unicode characters, like an HTML document.
Bytes/Byte array: Any type of file.
Lists: An ordered sequence of values.
Tuples: An ordered, immutable sequence of values.
Boolean: Holds either true or false values.
Sets: An unordered container of values.
Dictionaries: A key-paired values set in an unordered way.
Because Python is a pure object-oriented programming language,  so other data types are also available.

Module
Function
Class
Method
File
</h3>PYTHON VARIABLES</h2>
Variables are identifiers of a physical memory location, which is used to hold values temporarily during program execution.
Python interpreter allocates memory based on the values data type of variable, different data types like integers, decimals, characters, etc. can be stored in these variables.
Before learning about variables, you must know about values.

A value is one of the essential parts of a program, like a letter or a number.

</h2>PYTHON LIST</h2>
Dealing with data in a structured format is quite generous, and this is possible if those data are set accordingly in a specific manner. So, Python provides these data structures named 'lists' and 'tuples' that are used to organize data in a single set. Python has six built-in sequences, and among them, the most famous is "lists and tuples".
The lists are containers that hold some other objects in a given order. It usually puts into practice the sequence protocol and allows programmers to add or remove objects from that sequence. Each element of the sequence is assigned a number, i.e., the index and the first index is 0 (zero). This versatile data-type of Python is written in a sequence of the list separated by commas between expressions.
List apply the standard interface sequence in which len(L) returns the number of items present in the list, and L[i] represents the item at index i. Also L[i:j] returns new list containing objects within 'i' and 'j'.

<h2>PYTHON TUPLES</h2>
Some of the characteristics features of Tuples are:

Tuples are defined in the same way as lists.
They are enclosed within parenthesis and not within square braces.
Elements of the tuple must have a defined order.
Negative indices are counted from the end of the tuple, just like lists.
Tuple also has the same structure where commas separate the values.

<h2>PYTHON DATE AND TIME</h2>
There are various ways Python supplies date and time feature to add to the program. Python's Time and calendar module help in tracking date and time. Also, the 'DateTime' provides classes for controlling date and time in both simple and complex ways.
There are two different date and time objects in Python. These are:
naive
aware
The differences between 'naive' and 'aware' objects are:

The 'aware' object holds the details about time-zone and daylight saving information, whereas naïve objects do not have that feature.
Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with.
As we all can make an idea that time intervals have to be represented in floating-point numbers. Tick signifies the floating-point numbers in units of seconds in Python. Particular instants of time are represented in seconds from 12:00 am, 1st of January, of the year 1990. A popular module name 'time' is available, which provides functions that let's programmer work with the time and made conversion between time-representation possible.

The pre-defined function time.time() is used to return the current time of the system.

The daytime module exports the constants listed below:

MINYEAR
MAXYEAR
Python usually handles time's function as a tuple with nine numbers starting from zero (0) to eight (8).
It is used to represent duration, i.e., the difference between two dates and or times.  For invoking this, the syntax is:
This facility is provided by the "calendar" module, which offers a wide range of methods to deal with monthly calendars. <br><br>


<h2>CHAPTER:3 FLOW CONTROL</h2>
<h3>python decision making</h3>
Decisions in a program are used when the program has conditional choices to execute a code block. Let's take an example of traffic lights, where different colors of lights lit up in different situations based on the conditions of the road or any specific rule.
It is the prediction of conditions that occur while executing a program to specify actions. Multiple expressions get evaluated with an outcome of either TRUE or FALSE. These are logical decisions, and Python also provides decision-making statements that to make decisions within a program for an application based on the user requirement.
The decision-making structures can be recognized and understood using flowcharts.
elif - is a keyword used in Python replacement of else if to place another condition in the program. This is called chained conditional.
If the block of an executable statement of if - clause contains only a single line, programmers can write it on the same line as a header statement.
<h3>python loops</h3>
In programming, loops are a sequence of instructions that does a specific set of instructions or tasks based on some conditions and continue the tasks until it reaches certain conditions.
It is seen that in programming, sometimes we need to write a set of instructions repeatedly - which is a tedious task, and the processing also takes time. So in programming, we use iteration technique to repeat the same or similar type of tasks based on the specified condition.

Statements are executed sequentially, but there sometimes occur such cases where programmers need to execute a block of code several times. The control structures of programming languages allow us to execute a statement or block of statements repeatedly.<br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER:4 PYTHON FILE HANDLING</h3>
All programs need the input to process and output to display data. And everything needs a file as name storage compartments on computers that are managed by OS. Though variables provide us a way to store data while the program runs, if we want out data to persist even after the termination of the program, we have to save it to a file.
There are always two parts of a file in the computer system, the filename and its extension. Also, the files have two key properties - its name and the location or path, which specifies the location where the file exists. The filename has two parts, and they are separated by a dot (.) or period.
A built-in open method is used to create a Python file-object, which provides a connection to the file that is residing on the programmer's machine. After calling the function open, programmers can transfer strings of data to and from the external file that is residing in the machine.
filename: It is the name of the file.
mode: It tells the program in which mode the file has to be open.
buffering: Here, if the value is set to zero (0), no buffering will occur while accessing a file; if the value is set to top one (1), line buffering will be performed while accessing a file.

For reading and writing text data, different text-encoding schemes are used, such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format), UTF-16.
The problem can be easily solved by using another mode - technique, i.e., the 'x' mode to open a file instead of 'w' mode.
In Python, it is not system critical to close all your files after using them, because the file will auto close after Python code finishes execution. You can close a file by using the close() method.<br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER:5 PYTHON DICTIONARIES</h3>
Dictionary is like a list but in a general form. It can think like this; a dictionary is a mapping between a set of indexes or keys with a set of values, where each key maps to a value. A combination of a key and its value is called a key-value pair or item.

Suppose we take an example and build a dictionary that maps words from English to French. So the keys and their values will be all strings.

In the Python dictionary, each key is separated by a colon (:) from its values. Commas separate all the items, and the whole dictionary is enclosed within '{' and '}'. In the dictionary, all the keys should have to be unique with data type as strings, tuples, or numbers, and the values can be of any of these three types.
Dictionaries' values can be accessed by using the square braces, i.e. [ ], along with the key name to obtain the value. This are multiple item declaration procedures used to declare keys along with their values in Python's dictionary.
The function 'dict' creates a new dictionary with no items within it. This is because 'dict' is the name of a built-in function, and programmers should avoid using it as a variable name. Furthermore the curly braces { & }  together represents an empty dictionary. So to use the dictionary to add items, Python programmers use square braces such as:
Let us consider a situation where programmers are given, and they have to count how many times each letter appears.

To do this, the techniques are:

Create twenty-six variables, one for each letter of the alphabet & make the string traverse for each character, incrementing the corresponding counter variable.
Using a list, containing twenty-six elements & converting each letter to a specific number & use the number as an index to the list.
Programmers can also use dictionaries with letters as keys and counter as their corresponding values and add those items in the dictionary. Then, the programmer can increment the value of an existing item based on the repetition of every single letter.
It is based on the programmer what and how he/she wants to implement things into programming. An implementation is a method of doing or performing a computation based on your conception. In the above scenario, there is an advantage while using dictionaries - that we do not have to think or know ahead of which letter appears in the string and have to allot space and room for those letters.

<h3>python functions</h3>
Using a 'def' statement for defining a function is the corner store of a majority of programs in Python. To group a set of statements, programmers use functions, and they can be run more than once in a program. They act like a pack of instructions that is invoked by a name.
In simple words, Python functions are techniques used to combine a set of statements within a program. Functions also let programmers compute a result-value and give parameters that serve as function inputs that may change each time the code runs. Functions prove to be a useful tool when the operations are coded in it and can be used in a variety of scenarios.

Functions are an alternative method of cutting-and-pasting codes rather than typing redundant copies of the same instruction or operation, which further reduces the future work for programmers. They are the most basic structure of a program, and so Python provides this technique for code re-use.
The keyword 'def' introduces a function definition. The statements that form the body of the function starts from the next line of function definition and needs indentation. The execution of the function introduces a new symbol table that is used for the function's local variable. In other words, all the variables that are assigned to the function store their value in the local symbol table. So global variables cannot be assigned with a value within a function; unless it is named under 'global' statement. To accept any number of keyword arguments, the arguments have to start with *. A * argument can appear only in the last position of function's argument. A fine concept of a function definition is that arguments can still appear after the * argument.
Functions can be called in different ways.

These are:

Providing the mandatory argument only
Providing one of the optional argument
By giving all the arguments
Call Expression: myfun ('karl', 'os', *rest)
def : def display(message):
print ('Hi' +  message)
return : def sum(a, b=2)
return a+b
global : x = 'hello'
def printer():
global x; x='hi'
nonlocal : def outer():
a = 'old'
def inner():
nonlocal a; a = 'new'
yield : def sq(k)
for I in range(k): yield i**2<br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER:6 PYTHON EXCEPTION HANDLING</h3>
As at the beginning of this tutorial, we have studied the types of errors that could occur in a program. Sometimes we want to catch some or all of the errors that could get generated, and as a programmer, we need to be as specific as possible. Therefore, Python allows programmers to deal with errors efficiently.
Exceptions are events that are used to modify the flow of control through a program when the error occurs. Exceptions get triggered automatically on finding errors in Python.

These exceptions are processed using five statements. These are:<br>

try/except: catch the error and recover from exceptions hoist by programmers or Python itself.
try/finally: Whether exception occurs or not, it automatically performs the clean-up action.
assert: triggers an exception conditionally in the code.
raise: manually triggers an exception in the code.
with/as: implement context managers in older versions of Python such as - Python 2.6 & Python 3.0.
Exceptions allow us to jump out of random, illogical large chunks of codes in case of errors. Let us take a scenario that you have given a function to do a specific task. If you went there and found those things missing that are required to do that particular task, what will you do? Either you stop working or think about a solution - where to find those items to perform the task. The same thing happens here in case of Exceptions also. Exceptions allow programmers to jump an exception handler in a single step, abandoning all function calls. You can think exceptions to an optimized quality go-to statement, in which the program error that occurs at runtime gets easily managed by the exception block. When the interpreter encounters an error, it lets the execution go to the exception part to solve and continue the execution instead of stopping.<br>

While dealing with exceptions, the exception handler creates a mark & executes some code. Somewhere further within that program, the exception is raised that solves the problem & makes Python jump back to the marked location; by not throwing away/skipping any active functions that were called after the marker was left.
Error handling: The exceptions get raised whenever Python detects an error in a program at runtime. As a programmer, if you don't want the default behavior, then code a 'try' statement to catch and recover the program from an exception. Python will jump to the 'try' handler when the program detects an error; the execution will be resumed.
Event Notification: Exceptions are also used to signal suitable conditions & then passing result flags around a program and text them explicitly.<br>
Terminate Execution: There may arise some problems or errors in programs that it needs a termination. So try/finally is used that guarantees that closing-time operation will be performed. The 'with' statement offers an alternative for objects that support it.
Exotic flow of Control: Programmers can also use exceptions as a basis for implementing unusual control flow. Since there is no 'go to' statement in Python so that exceptions can help in this respect.

<h2>CHAPTER:7 PYTHON OOP'S</h2>
The python is an Object-oriented programming language. This means there exists a concept called 'class' that lets the programmer structure the codes of software in a fashioned way. Because of the use of classes and objects, the programming became easy to understand and code.<br>


class: Classes are a user-defined data type that is used to encapsulate data and associated functions together. It also helps in binding data together into a single unit.
Data Member: A variable or memory location name that holds value to does a specific task within a program.
Member Function: They are the functions, usually a block of a code snippet that is written to re-use it.
Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method of a class.
Function Overloading: This technique is used to assign multiple tasks to a single function, and the tasks are performed based on the number of arguments or the type of argument the function has.
Operator Overloading: It is the technique of assigning multiple functions/tasks to a particular operator.
Inheritance: It is the process of acquiring the properties of one class to another, i.e., one class can acquire the properties of another.
Instantiation: It is the technique of creating an instance of a class.

<h2>CHAPTER:8 INHERITENCE OF PYTHON</h3>
Inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism are the four fundamental concepts provided by OOP (Object Oriented Programming). Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that allows programmers to enable a new class to receive - or inherit all the properties & methods of existing class/classes. As we all came to know, that class is a blueprint or template of an object. Every object is built from a class, and the concept 'inheritance' is used to create a relationship between these blueprints.
It is a feature of object-oriented programming which is used to define a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called the derived class or child class, and the class from which this derived class has been inherited is the base class or parent class. The derived class is formed from a base class, plus it may include some extra additional features. This inheritance concept helps to reuse the code.

<h3>PYTHON ADVANCED</h2>
<h3>python regular expression</h3>
Regular expressions are a very useful technique for extracting information from text such as code, spreadsheets, documents, or log-files. The first thing to keep in mind while implementing regular expression is that everything essentially needs to be a character, and programmers write patterns to match a specific sequence of characters/strings.
Regular expressions are characters in particular order that help programmers find other sequences of characters or strings or set of strings using specific syntax held in a pattern. Python supports regular expressions through the standard Python library's' which is packed with every Python installation.
<h3>python networking programming</h3>
Python plays an essential role in network programming. The standard library of Python has full support for network protocols, encoding, and decoding of data and other networking concepts, and it is simpler to write network programs in Python than that of C++.
There are two levels of network service access in Python. These are:

Low-Level Access
High-Level Access
In the first case, programmers can use and access the basic socket support for the operating system using Python's libraries, and programmers can implement both connection-less and connection-oriented protocols for programming.

Application-level network protocols can also be accessed using high-level access provided by Python libraries. These protocols are HTTP, FTP, etc.
<h3>python cgi programming</h3>
CGI is a set of standards that defines a standard way of passing information or web-user requests to an application program and getting data back to forward it to users. It is the exchange of information between the web server and a custom script. When the users requested the web-page, the server sends the requested web-page. The web server usually passes the information to all application programs that process data and sends back an acknowledged message; this technique of passing data back-and-forth between server and application is the Common Gateway Interface. The current version of CGI is CGI/1.1 & CGI/1.2 is under process.
What happens when a user clicks a hyperlink to browse a particular web-page or URL (Uniform Resource Locator).

The steps are:

Browser contacts the HTTP web server for demanding the URL
Parsing the URL
Look for the filename
If it finds that file, a request is sent back
Web browser takes a response from the webserver
As the server response, it either shows the received file or an error message.
It may become possible to set-up an HTTP server because when a certain directory is requested, that file is not sent back; instead, it is executed as a program, and that program's output is displayed back to your browser.

<h3>python database connection</h3>
Programmers can expect Python to make database programming more painless and straightforward work, supplying the Python database API with a database-neutral programming interface for various databases.
These are:

MySQL
SQLite
MS SQL
PostgreSQL
Informix
Sybase
Inter-base
Oracle etc….
<h3>python processing an dencoding</h3>
Data can be presented in different kinds of encoding, such as CSV, XML, and JSON, etc. For each case, the processing format is different. Python can handle various encoding processes, and different types of modules need to be imported to make these encoding techniques work.
CSV (Common Separated Data) files to store data that are in tabular format into plain text & each line is treated as a data record in the file. Each record holds one or more fields separated by commas. Here's a typical format of tabular data along with its CSV data - record.<br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER:9 PYTHON GUI PROGRAMMING</h3>
Python provides several different options for writing GUI based programs. These are listed below:

Tkinter: It is easiest to start with. Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (graphical user interface) package. It is the most commonly used toolkit for GUI programming in Python.
JPython: It is the Python platform for Java that is providing Python scripts seamless access o Java class Libraries for the local machine.
wxPython: It is an open-source, cross-platform GUI toolkit written in C++. It is one of the alternatives to Tkinter, which is bundled with Python.
There are many other interfaces available for GUI. But these are the most commonly used ones. In this, we will learn about the basic GUI programming using Tkinter.
It is the standard GUI toolkit for Python. Fredrik Lundh wrote it. For modern Tk binding, Tkinter is implemented as a Python wrapper for the Tcl Interpreter embedded within the interpreter of Python. Tk provides the following widgets:

button
canvas
combo-box
frame
level
check-button

<h3>create API documentation file in python</h3>
An API document file is a text or HTML file that contains a description of all the features of the software, language, or product. It creates by a developer, which helps other developers to understand the software and use it correctly. This file also includes details about the classes, modules, functions, etc. used in the software.
The following Python program includes two functions. The first function is multiplication function that takes two numbers in the form of input and displays their multiplication, and the second function is show function that displays a welcome message to the screen.
In the above example program, it used multiply-two-numbers.py as a file name, but you can save as name whatever you want.
Triple double quote (""") and single quote (''') are called documentation string if these strings are written as first statements in a module, function, class or a method.
This is a standard procedure to execute any Python program. To create an API document, we need to re-execute the program with the Python pydoc module.
n the above command:

-m representing a module.
pydoc is the name of the module.
-w indicates that an HTML file to be created.
multiply-to-numbers is a source file name.
The above program displays the output and creates an HTML file named multiply-two-numbers.html.
